            <h2>1. What is version control and how does Git work?</h2>
            <p>
              Version control is a system that helps track changes to files over
              time. It allows multiple developers (or even a single developer)
              to collaborate, manage different versions of their code, and track
              history in a way that enables easy rollback or recovery of earlier
              versions. It also helps in merging changes made by different
              contributors to the same project.
            </p>

            <p>
              Git is a distributed version control system. It allows each user
              to have a complete local copy of the repository, with the entire
              history of changes. This means Git works even when you're offline,
              and you can sync your local changes with a remote repository when
              you are ready.

              2. What are the 3 possible states of files? (Modified, Staged and
              Committed)
            </h2>
            <p>
              <b>Modified:</b> The file has been changed in the working
              directory (your local machine), but the changes have not yet been
              staged (added to the index) or committed to the repository.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Staged:</b> The file is in the staging area (index), meaning it
              is prepared and ready to be committed to the local repository. It
              has been added using the git add command.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Commited:</b> The changes are saved to the local repository,
              which means they have been stored and the history has been
              updated. A committed file is part of the version history.

            <h2>3. How to start a git repository in a project?</h2>
            <p>To start a Git repository in a project, follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Navigate to your project folder using the command line or
                terminal.
              </li>
              <li>Initialize a Git repository by running: git init</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              This command creates a hidden .git directory, marking the folder
              as a Git repository.

            <h2>4. How to store changes to files in Git?</h2>
            <p>To store changes to files in Git, you follow a few steps:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Stage the files using git add: git add 'filename' or git add .
              </li>
              <li>
                Commit the changes using git commit: git commit -m 'feat(init):
                Create initial file'
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              The git add command stages the changes, and git commit stores them
              in the repository's history.
            </p>

          <div class="question">
            <h2>5. How to view the change history?</h2>
            <p>
              To view the change history in Git, you can use the git log
              command: git log
            </p>
            <p>
              This will show a list of commits, including the commit ID, author,
              date, and commit message. You can add additional flags to
              customize the output, for example: git log --oneline
            </p>

              6. How to add files to an already Committed file, remove a file
              from the Staged state and discard changes to a Modified file?
              (amend, reset, checkout)
            </h2>
            <p>
              <b>(Amend)</b> If you want to modify the most recent commit (for
              example, adding a new file or changing the commit message):
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Stage the new file: git add 'filename'</li>
              <li>Amend the last commit: git commit --amend</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              This will open your default text editor where you can modify the
              commit message, or you can add the --no-edit flag to keep the
              existing message.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <p>
              <b>(Reset)</b> If you've staged a file but decide not to commit
              it, you can remove it from the staging area: git reset 'filename'
            </p>
            <p>
              This moves the file from the staged area back to the modified
              state, without losing any changes made to the file.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <p>
              <b>(Checkout)</b> If you want to discard local changes and restore
              the file to its last committed state, use: git checkout --
              'filename'
            </p>
            <p>
              This command replaces the file with its version from the last
              commit, effectively discarding your local changes.
